universe.cc		MainLoop, ogl = OpenGLClass, Update, UpdateDraw, 

# move UpdateOrganism from universe to organism... since it passes in organism* ?
# still it uses orglist which is a member of universe class...

DEBUGS:
  _DEBUG			energy, gene, opengl, universe
  _NN_DEBUG			universe
  _DEBUG_FOOD		universe
  _DEBUG_FIGHT		universe

in Makefile: _NN_DEBUG getchars... grrrr....
DEFS = -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I$(srcdir) -I. -D_DEBUG -D_NN_DEBUG -D_DEBUG_FOOD -D_DEBUG_FIGHT

!TOFIX: eating... iterates over whole foodlist but checks if org hungry... well, hmmm... breaks, OK

question of name... since github mirror required some label:
not sure why it was called achilles in the first place, but...
achilles had a son neoptolemos (or -mus) or pyrrhus (yeah, epir claimed to be
descendants of achilles... whateva...), but...
after his death there was a small island on the black sea (near the mouth of
danube river) dedicated to his worship, by sea merchants and the like rabble,
filled with wild, sacrificial animals and birds - called Leukos (white island,
koz of marble deposits) or achilleis (island of achilles) or Leuce (in
engrish?)... latinized into Achillea (but this is a name of popular plant),
so i went with googlicious word-smithy of achilleukos... THE END (for now!)
