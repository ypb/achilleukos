Porting Achilles (http://achilles.sourceforge.net/ or rather
http://packages.debian.org/achilles), an artificial life and evolution
simulator that uses Hebbian neural networks and OpenGL/SDL to simulate life
in a simplified environment (it is based on Larry Yaeger's PolyWorld idea) to
libtcod (http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/) with an ultimate goal of having,
if not NPCs, at least interesting mobs in a god rogue-like, city-builder, colo-
nization-like game.

There are of course more robust and advanced projects like OpenNERO (with its
rtNEAT engine) or mentioned above PolyWorld, but I find this forgotten univer-
sity semester job to be a nice trampoline for my own devious ends, Larry W.
said laziness is one of programmers virtues. Still if anything becomes of this
effort there is always a possibility of enfolding other AIlife libs and ideas
into this experiment and forking it into a rogueAlIc (rogue artificial little
intelligence creatures or "rogalik" - a croissant in Polish ;)
